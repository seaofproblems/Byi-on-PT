# Byi-on-PT (This is just backup "about me", when my rentry is finished I will delete this and put the info in my rentry)
These are mostly aimed towards the gi people
1. If this triggered you don't attack me
 - I don't really like ScaraMona (DNI for this one), All x Traveller (Fine with Scrlm/ae, Chilm/ae, Xlm/ae), DottoScara, KaeLuc,... please put that in mind. But I respect it, I hope if you ship them you should be respecting the ships I love. If you also ship my Scara ships, or ships Scara with no one, then it's fine, even if you ship the ships I don't like ;3
 - Oh and my favourite ships if you want to know..!! - ChiScara, HaiKaveh, XingYun, JeanLuc/JeanLisa but I love JeanLisa more, CyNari, Zhongchi,.. All KNY canon ships, CRK: SeaMoon, VampMint. I'm in thin ice about shipping ScrKz.. Some ships that I don't mention means I'm fine with it, just not my favourites! (Not the problematics ones). I'm fine with HeiScara, ScaraBedo, Scrlm (?) the rest of Scara ships are a no.
2. Int with me! (Aimed towards Pony Town people)
 - Please interact with me I'm always so lonely because most of my friends go offline or quitted. We can talk about something that is not about ships which I HATE talking about that, even if we have the same interests in ships. Cuddling + hiding with me is okay, I DON'T MIND if your skin is Mona or Lumine/Aether,.. Because I'm really happy to have someone with me!
 - Roleplaying is okay! I enjoy it pretty much idk, just don't get others cringed because I'm gonna get embarrassed... :<
 - Don't public chat to me (If we're not green names) . Because I would mostly afk and lose your messages. So whisper to me! I will 100% respond to you unless you're saying weird ass things. If I'm AFK that means I'm at school or something like that, so it will take a while for me to respond.
 - I don't hide/block people, I only hide/block them for few minutes when I feel uncomfortable. I would be really sad if people hid/blocked me :(
3. More notes (For everyone)
 - I'm not going to avoid you just because you ships the ships that I don't like ;3, ofc if you respect me back. I will try my best to hold the converstations, and will try my best to end if we're in a fight... I hate fighting over stupid things that we both will live ><.
 - Please I don't wanna talk with anger issues people,.. I'm scared of angry people. Because I might say things that triggered you
 - One more thing that I'm 16, if you're under 13 then erm its alright? I won't say anything stupid, but best to just stay away from me. (except my sister Mizu! ><)
