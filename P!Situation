Nothing's too important here.
I'm taking a break from the Phighting fandom/shipdom. The reasons are simple yet dumb.. For me.
So, everything all started when Sodakettle made a lore drop about Subspace and Medkit (erm its actually nothing too shocking, everyone knows Subspaces a bad guy). well I kinda got a bit too upset when she said she didn't like S u b k i t. I get the reason why people hate that ship, just even the dev hated it made me sad.
The next day, my mood got better since I told myself it's not really a big deal, I could just take a break then I'd be better. Yeah it did.. For few hours.
Then Soda called "icky i n c e s t shit subkit" (found on bsky).. ??? Subkit's a fucking incest ship?? Bro what did I miss.
This is why I really want to take a break from the fandom, Soda announcing that it is an incest ship, out of nowhere, no one's questioning about that reply..
It's okay, It's okay. I can't even do anything about it. 
But anyway I'm a multishipper so I still have more comfort ships by my side. But this situation is just.. Making me upset. So taking a break is still the best idea.
You can still be my friend, just don't mention Subkit, I wanna stay away from them. Unless you meant (idk how to explain this) normal Subspace and Medkit interactions that have nothing to do with the ships.
