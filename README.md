If this triggered you don't get mad and attack me..
 - First thing, I don't really like ScaraMona, ScaraLumi (I hate All x Traveller), DottoScara, LyScara, CyScara, ScaraRina, ScaraKoko,... please put that in mind. But I respect it, I hope if you ship them you should be respecting the ships I love. What I meant is please don't yap about those ships that you like, I'm not gonna talk about mines too. The exception is that you also ship my Scara ships, or ships Scara with no one, love these rare people.
 - Next, please talk with me I'm always so lonely because most of my friends go offline or quitted. We can talk about something that is not about ships which I HATE talking about that, even if we have the same interests in ships. Cuddling + hiding with me is okay I DON'T MIND if your skin is Mona or Lumine/Aether,.. I'm really happy to have someone with me!
 - Roleplaying is okay! I enjoy it but not much, just don't get others cringed because I'm gonna get embarrassed... :<
 - Don't chat publicly in the game to me (If we haven't met) . Because I would mostly afk and lost your messages. So whisper to me! I will 100% respond to you unless you're saying weird ass things.
 - I'm not going to avoid you just because you ships the ships that I don't like ;3, ofc if you respect me back. I will try my best to hold the converstations, and will try my best to end if we're in a fight... I hate fighting over stupid things that we both will live.
 - Please I don't wanna talk with anger issues people,.. I'm scared of angry people! Because I might say things that triggered you. Sorry!
 - Oh and my favourite ships if you want to know..!! (ChiScara, ScaraKz.. pls don't explode my house, I swear I'm not the weird ass shippers! I'm not even in the shipdom.. HaiKaveh, XingYun, JeanLuc/JeanLisa but I love JeanLisa more, CyNari, YatoThoma, Zhongchi, All KNY canon ships, CRK: SeaMoon, VampMint.)
