# RBYI (my boundaries)
1. Int with me! (For Pony Town players)
 - I'm mostly at Roblox areas (There are 2 currently).
 - Please interact with me I'm always so lonely because most of my friends go offline or quitted. We can talk about something that is not about ships which I HATE talking about that, unless I'm getting more comfortable around you. Cuddling + hiding with me is super recommended (no need to ask first).
 - Roleplaying is okay, only with my friends as we're doing it as a jokes
 - Don't public chat to me (If we're not moots) . Because I would mostly offtab and your messages will be lost. So whisper to me! I will 100% respond to you (unless you're saying weird ass things), I respond fast, if I aren't then I might be a bit busy. 
 - I don't hide/block people freely, I only do it for few minutes when I feel uncomfortable. I would be really sad if people hid/blocked me without telling the reasons..
2. More notes (For everyone)
 - I'm a multishipper! I enjoy every single ship tbh. Just not Genshin Impact, gave me enough stress. And about the toxic ships, I only like them for the angst, no I can't imagine them being happy together for once, I love angst man
 - Please I don't wanna talk with anger issues, sensitive or mental issues people,.. Because I might say things that triggered you, I just can't words my sentences correctly sometimes.
 - Never take what I say seriously, like, all I said was a joke and never serious for once, and I don't use tonetags much. The only tonetags I use most are "/srs" and "/genq", but you can spot the serious tone right.
 - I yap, rant a lot (If you don't receive my yapping msgs yes I'm afraid I might disturb you..), please tell me if you don't like it (because I sometimes forget to check people's status before dm-ing I apologize, If I accidentally made that mistake I swear I'd feel insanely guilty).
 - Venting to me is never recommended, I don't know how to comfort people and can't handle negative energies. (Friends can still do it, but I'll stay silent because I don't want to accidentally trigger you.). I don't comfort people, I give honest advice.
