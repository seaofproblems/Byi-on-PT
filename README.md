# RBYI (my boundaries)
Do note that English is not my first language and I often make mistake by typing so fast, I won't fix the grammar if it's still understandable.
1. Int with me! (For Pony Town players)
 - I'm mostly at Roblox areas. There are 2 currently BUT I will never go to the area at the top left corner from now on :). I'll only be there for my friends.
 - Be my friend be my friend be my friend. I'm always so open about making new friends (esp we when match energy)!!! We can talk about something that is not about ships which I HATE talking about that, unless I'm getting more comfortable around you. Cuddling + hiding with me is super recommended (no need to ask first).
 - Well, don't mind me if I just walk to you and c+h with you without saying anything, I c + h freely hahaa..!
 - Roleplaying is okay, only with my friends as we're doing it as a joke.
 - Don't public chat to me (If we're not green names). Because I would mostly offtab and your messages will be lost. So whisper to me! I will 100% respond to you (unless you're saying weird ass things), I respond fast, if I aren't then I might be a bit busy (will be stated through my name). 
 - I DON'T hide/block people freely, I only do it for few minutes when I feel uncomfortable. I would be really sad if people hid/blocked me without telling the reasons.. I want to be everyone's friend okay I don't wanna make anyone upset : J
2. More notes, for everyone
 - I'm a multishipper! I enjoy every single ship tbh. Just not Genshin Impact, gave me enough stress. And about the toxic ships, I only like them for the angst, no I can't imagine them being happy together for once, I love angst man
 - Please I don't wanna talk with anger issues, sensitive or mental issues people,.. Because I might say things that triggered you, I just can't words my sentences correctly sometimes.
 - Never take what I say seriously, like, all I said was a joke and never serious for once, and I don't use tonetags much. The only tonetags I use most are "/srs" and "/genq", but you can spot the serious tone right. Hey if you're not in the age I only interact, it's alright to talk to me, no weird topics that's all. (Huge age gap I'll consider ignoring)
 - I yap, rant a lot, on dms or on calls (If you don't have my yapping msgs daily yes I'm afraid I might disturb you..), please tell me if you don't like it (because I sometimes forget to check people's status before dm-ing I apologize, If I accidentally made that mistake I swear I'd feel insanely guilty).
 - I HATE getting ignored. If I did get ignored, I'd just stay silent and upset for the whole time. Or, if you talk to me in a dry tone, I'd leave you alone because I'm scared, a silent apology.
 - Venting to me is never recommended, I don't know how to comfort people and I can't handle negative energies. (Close friends can still do it, but I'd stay silent because I don't want to accidentally trigger you).

I'd be surprised if you actually read it all : P, now be my frienddd I'm super friendly!!
