# RBYI (my boundaries)
1. Int with me! (For Pony Town players)
 - I'm mostly at Roblox areas (There are 2 currently).
 - Please interact with me I'm always so lonely because most of my friends go offline or quitted. We can talk about something that is not about ships which I HATE talking about that, unless I'm getting more comfortable around you. Cuddling + hiding with me is okay (no need to ask first), I DON'T MIND if your skin is a character I don't like,.. Because I'm really happy to have someone with me!
 - Roleplaying is okay! I enjoy it pretty much idk, just don't get others cringed because I'm gonna get embarrassed dawg
 - Don't public chat to me (If we're not moots) . Because I would mostly offtab and your messages will be lost. So whisper to me! I will 100% respond to you (unless you're saying weird ass things), I respond fast, if I aren't then I might be a bit busy. 
 - I don't hide/block people freely, I only do it for few minutes when I feel uncomfortable. I would be really sad if people hid/blocked me without telling the reasons..
2. More notes (For everyone)
 - I'm a multishipper! I enjoy every single ship tbh.
 - Please I don't wanna talk with anger issues, sensitive or mental issues people,.. Because I might say things that triggered you, I just can't words my sentences correctly sometimes.
 - Never take what I say seriously, since I won't use tonetags for my jokingly and sarcastic speech or wtv it's called. The only tonetags I use most are "/srs" and "/genq"
 - I yap, rant a lot, please tell me if you don't like it (because I sometimes forget to check people's status before dm-ing I apologize).
 - Venting to me is never recommended, I do not know how to comfort people and can't handle negative energies.
